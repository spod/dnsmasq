## nftables for gokrazy

This package is a [frozen](https://github.com/gokrazy/freeze) version of
`nftables`, coming from [Debian
“trixie” (currently testing)](https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/).

This package is to support playing with [nftables](http://nftables.org/) using gokrazy breakglass to help develop golang code using [google/nftables](https://github.com/google/nftables/) as described in [google/nftables issue #5](https://github.com/google/nftables/issues/5).

This package is based on [gokrazy/iptables](https://github.com/gokrazy/iptables).
